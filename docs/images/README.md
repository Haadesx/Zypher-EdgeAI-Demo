# Architecture Diagram

This directory contains images for documentation.

To create the architecture diagram, you can use tools like:
- [Mermaid](https://mermaid.js.org/) (render from markdown)
- [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) (export as SVG)
- [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com/) (hand-drawn style)

The README references `architecture_diagram.svg` which should be created
and placed here.
